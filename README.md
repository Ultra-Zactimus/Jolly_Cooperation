I am going to continue watching Mosh's tutorial because I am still not 100% sure how to get going on this app yet.

9:34am Continuing to watch the Mosh tutorial

12:33pm gonna have to start the project over from scratch. never installed react native before expo and missing the correct files. project will not build. probably gonna stop coding to not lose progress on attendance and try to do that this weekend.
12:33pm taking a lunnch break

1:48pm after trying to get this working I am starting to fear that I may need to change my proposal to normal React. I am having a super hard time just getting this to work
 1:56 I am changing my proposal from a mobile app to a React app. React native is giving me too many problems and I dont think I have enough time to figure it out before presentations
